            <p class="aboutMe"> Hello! I am Conner. I am a new North Carolina transplant who has become interested in coding. The majority of my professional career has been spent in Freightliner 
                dealerships where I have worked as a Warehouse Associate, Parts Salesman, Assistant Parts Manager, and Service Manager. Throughout my professinal career, I have
                always had an interest in how things worked. This has led me to pursue a career in coding, as I find the construction of application fascinating. For hobbies, I 
                spend most of my time outside of work hiking, backpacking, or working out. I very much enjoy being outdoors. Enjoy my portfolio!
